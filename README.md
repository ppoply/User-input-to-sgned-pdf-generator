# User-input-to-signed-pdf-generator

A Simple User input to Signed-pdf generator using PHP.
- User input is taken through a textbox (Bootstrap used for the frontend).
- For converting the user input to Signed-PDF PHP's TCPDF library has been used.
- Preservation of Line breaks has been taken care off.
- Validation of the Digital Signature will have to be done by the User/Certificate authority accordingly. This is just a template to for creating a SPDF through user input.
- TCPDF's Example 052 has been taken for reference for the code.
